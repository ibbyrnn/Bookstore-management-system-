# Bookstore-management-system-
This project is a Bookstore Management System developed in x86 Assembly Language using TASM (Turbo Assembler). It demonstrates low-level programming concepts to manage bookstore operations such as viewing inventory, filtering books, and updating stock â€” all from a DOS-like interface.

The system showcases how powerful assembly language can be in handling real-world business logic even with limited resources and direct memory/register management.
